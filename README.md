## Usage ##

When working with releases or templates, you will find an additional option called **`Relationships`** in the drop down menu.

The plugin will analyse all **`xlrelease.CreateReleaseTask`** and **`xlrelease.GateTask`** tasks in the current release/template and its targets to build up the relationship graph.
Currently references to release-as-code (xfile) script tasks are not supported.

## Development ##

This plugin is built using Node.js, Webpack and Gradle.
Execute `./gradlew clean build` in the project root to build.

### Setup development XL Release Server ###

You can setup your local development XL Release Server to point to the compiled build by modifying the classpath variable, `XL_RELEASE_SERVER_CLASSPATH`, in `<xlr-home>/bin/run.sh` 

Example :

```
DEV_HOME="/Users/ravan/labs/repos/xebialabs-community/xlr-relationship-visualization-plugin"
DEV_SERVER_CLASSPATH="${DEV_HOME}/build/app:${DEV_HOME}/src/main/resources/:${DEV_HOME}/src/main/jython/"
XL_RELEASE_SERVER_CLASSPATH="${DEV_SERVER_CLASSPATH}:${classpath_dirs}"

#XL_RELEASE_SERVER_CLASSPATH="${classpath_dirs}"
```

### Live Update ###

Once you've started the development XLR server, you can execute `npm run watch` in the project root.  Now everytime you edit the source, it will be automatically compiled and your browser automatically refreshed to reflect the changes.
